# golour

Create some interesting RGBA images with the help of the golang image package.


### Example 1 - x * y

![Green image with wave like looking shapes that can be mirrored or inverted depending on where you split the image](https://github.com/sonlar/golour/blob/main/img/image_0.png)

### Example 2 - x + y

![Green image with a recursive square looking shapes that can be mirrored or inverted depending on where you split the image](https://github.com/sonlar/golour/blob/main/img/image_2.png)

### Example 3 - x ^ y

![Green image with a diagonal split where bottom right corner starts with a 255 green value. The green value moves towards 0 as it approaches the diagonal split. Where the opposite is happening on the top left split, so top left starts with a 0 green value(black), and as it approaches the diagonal split it gets closer to a 255 green value](https://github.com/sonlar/golour/blob/main/img/image_4.png)
